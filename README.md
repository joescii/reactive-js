## Instructions
1. Run `./present`.
2. Aim your browser at `http://localhost:8080`.

## Abstract

Reactive has become one of the top buzzwords in our industry.
Join me for a brief introduction into the principles of reactive programming, followed by deep dive into applying the principles to your JavaScript code.
By the end of this session, you will know what patterns emerge when the reactive rubber meets the programming road.

After a brief introduction into reactive programming, we will get our hands dirty live coding with *Q*'s **Promises**.
Next we will explore the treatment of events as **Streams** as implemented in the *Reactive-Extensions/RxJS* library.
Lastly, we look at concurrency in the browser via **Web Workers**.
With these three tools, you will be well-equipped to write elegant, maintainable, reactive JavaScript code.
